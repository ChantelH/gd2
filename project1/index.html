        <section>
            <p>Ten days after I called off my engagement I was supposed to go on a scientific expedition to study the
                whooping crane on the gulf coast of Texas. Surely, I will cancel this trip, I thought, as I shopped for
                nylon hiking
                pants that zipped off at the knee. Surely, a person who calls off a wedding is meant to be sitting sadly
                at
                home, reflecting on the enormity of what has transpired and not doing whatever it is I am about to be
                doing
                that
                requires a pair of plastic clogs with drainage holes. Surely, I thought, as I tried on a very large and
                floppy hat
                featuring a pull cord that fastened beneath my chin, it would be wrong to even be wearing a hat that
                looks
                like
                this when something in my life has gone so terribly wrong.</p>

            <p>Ten days earlier I had cried and I had yelled and I had packed up my dog and driven away from the upstate
                New
                York house with two willow trees I had bought with my fiancé.</p>

            <p>Ten days later and I didn’t want to do anything I was supposed to do.</p>

        <section>
            <p> I went to Texas to study the whooping crane because I was researching a novel. In my novel there were
                biologists doing field research about birds and I had no idea what field research actually looked like
                and
                so the
                scientists in my novel draft did things like shuffle around great stacks of papers and frown. The good
                people of the Earthwatch organization assured me I was welcome on the trip and would get to participate
                in
                “real
                science” during my time on the gulf. But as I waited to be picked up by my team in Corpus Christi, I was
                nervous—I imagined everyone else would be a scientist or a birder and have daunting binoculars.</p>

            <!--I don't like that it separated my text like this is there a way to fix it or clean it up?-->

            <p>The biologist running the trip rolled up in in a large white van with a boat hitch and the words
                <strong><em>BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES</em></strong> stenciled across the side. Jeff was forty-ish, and wore
                sunglasses and a backward baseball cap. He had a winter beard and a neon-green cast on his left arm.
                He’d
                broken his
                arm playing hockey with his sons a week before. The first thing Jeff said was, <i>“We’ll head back to
                    camp,
                    but I hope you don’t mind we run by the liquor store
                    first.”</i> I felt more optimistic about my suitability for science.</p>

        <section class="last">
            <!--Here, I was trying to figure out how ti make the bottom margin of the last sentence match the margin in h1-->
            <p>Not long before I’d called off my engagement it was Christmas.</p>

            <!--Here also, basically all over, I've been trying to clean it up myself, but it doesn't really appear to help much!-->

            <p>The woman who was <i>supposed</i> to be my mother-in-law was a wildly talented quilter and made stockings
                with Beatrix Potter characters on them for every family member. The previous Christmas she had asked me
                what
                character I wanted to be (my fiancé was Benjamin Bunny). I agonized over the decision. It felt
                important, like whichever character I chose would represent my role in this new family. I chose Squirrel
                Nutkin, a squirrel
                with a blazing red tail—an epic, adventuresome figure who ultimately loses his tail as the price for his
                daring and
                pride.</p>

            <p>I arrived in Ohio that Christmas and looked to the banister to see where my squirrel had found his place.
                Instead, I found a mouse. A <em>mouse</em> in a pink dress and apron. A <em>mouse</em> holding a broom
                and
                dustpan, serious about sweeping. A<em>mouse</em> named Hunca Munca. The woman who was <em>supposed</em>
                to
                become my
                mother-in-law said, <i>“I was going to do the squirrel but then I thought, that just isn’t CJ. This is
                    CJ.”</i></p>

            <p>What she was offering was so nice. She was so nice. I thanked her and felt ungrateful for having wanted a
                stocking, but not this stocking. Who was I to be choosy? To say that this nice thing she was offering
                wasn’t
                a thing I wanted?</p>

            <p>When I looked at that mouse with her broom, I wondered which one of us was wrong about who
                <strong><em>I</em></strong> was.
